# How Do I Create a LOG File?

If you've been asked to collect a DOFLinx.LOG file then you are likely chasing an issue and it needs to be posted somewhere.  As a matter of good etiquette create and post a succinct LOG file that shows your issue as promptly as possible.  Do not log a heap of game play if you don't need to.

The steps are:

1. Stop DOFLinx.  Either hold Alt-Tab and click the close "X" in the right-hand corner of the program images displayed, or from the command line use "DOFLinxMsg QUIT".
2. Delete the current DOFLinx.LOG file.
3. Edit DOFLinx.INI and set DEBUG=1 or DEBUG=2.  DEBUG=1 will show DOFLinx on screen, 2 will not.  They both log the same information.
4. Start DOFLinx using your shortcut, or reboot, whichever is easier.
5. Perform the activity that you are having an issue with.
6. Stop DOFLinx as per step #1 above.
7. Either copy the DOFLinx.LOG file ready for posting or post it direct now.
8. Edit your DOFLinx.INI file and set DEBUG=0 or place a # at the beginning of the line to comment it out.
9. Restart DOFLinx using your shortcut or reboot.

When you post the DOFLinx.LOG file, make sure you describe the actions you undertook while logging.  All details help.
