# Testing Your Setup

Of course you can dive straight in, fire it up and kick off your
emulator. This can be a bit confusing, and the recycle time to change
and test again can get annoying. Instead set DEBUG=1, start-up DOFLinx
and press the "Fake Emulation On" button, it will now change to a "Fake
Emulation Off" button.

Once activated you can try out all of your keys, colours, etc. If you
need to change things, just use "Quit", edit your INI and go again. When
you're done, edit your INI back to DEBUG=0.
