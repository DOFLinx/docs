For more help .....

a)	Read the full guide

b)	Go over to www.vpforums.org/index.php?showforum=104 and search out your issue.  If you can’t find what you are looking for then start a new support thread (be nice and don’t divert an old one unless you have exactly the same issue).  I know one of the very knowledgeable and friendly people there will help you out
