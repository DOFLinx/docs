## MAME

DOFLinx integrates with a custimed version of MAME to send live scores, credits, level, shots, hits and more.  What can be sent is game dependant with most popular games having at least score.  With the score comes the ability to trigger standard cabinet toys such as addressable LEDs, flashers, solenoids, knocker (don't forget Qbert actually uses that!), illuminate buttons, joystick, etc.
