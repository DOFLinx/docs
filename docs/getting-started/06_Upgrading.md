# Upgrading

As per installation, just unpack the new EXE file over the top of the
old one. Of course, you might need to kill off the DOFLinx process if
you have it running at all times as a set and forget.

Notes

1. From Version 2.0 all lists in the INI that were space separated are
  now comma separated. This means all lists are comma separated. Space
  separated lists no longer work from version 7.0
2. At installation or upgrade, you may need to "unblock" the EXE file
  if you are using Windows 10. Just right click, properties, and
  unblock.
3. Under Windows 8 and 10 you may need to "run as administrator".
4. For the FP table link to work you will need DOFLinx to run with
  administrator rights.

!!! note

    From version 7.0 there is no need to run with administrator rights unless you run any of your pinball emulators with administrator rights.
