# 32 or 64 Bit

The default installation of DOFLinx above is 64 bit.  You must change this to 32 bit only if you have a 32 bit operating system.  If you are unsure run DOFLinxConfig and check in the bottom right-hand corner (see image above), it will tell you.

Others may choose to change to a 32 bit installation, that too is fine.  DOFLinx 32 bit and 64 bit have identical operation, 64 bit just has access to more memory and is arguable marginally faster.

For those still running some 32 bit pinball tools, please note that your DOFLinx installation does not need to match those.  Provided DOFLinx has access to the correct bit sized DirectOutput.dll then it can operate as 64 bit while you run other pinball utilities, even those using DOF, as 32 bit.

To change to 32 bit just copy the contents of \DOFLinx\32 bit into \DOFLinx.  To go back to 64 bit do the reverse and copy the contents of \DOFLinx\64 bit to \DOFLinx.  If you are unsure if you have it right then run DOFLinxConfig to check.  A mixture of 32 and 64 bit will cause some issues.
