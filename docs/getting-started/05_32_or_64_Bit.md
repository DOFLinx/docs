# 32 or 64 Bit

DOFLinx has both 32 and 64 bit versions. They have identical
functionality and should be selected as per your choice and requirement.
The key is that you must have the matching 32 or 64 bit installation of
DOF. So both 32 bit or both 64 bit, not a mismatch. Of course to use the
64 bit version you must also have a 64 bit version of Windows installed.
