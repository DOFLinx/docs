# Upgrading

1. Save a copy of your DOFLinx.INI file

2. As per installation, just unpack the new EXE file over the top of the old one.  Of course, you might need to stop the DOFLinx process if you have it running at all times as a set and forget.
   
3. Replace your DOFLinx.INI file

Notes

a)	From Version 2.0 all lists in the INI that were space separated are now comma separated.  This means all lists are comma separated.  Space separated lists no longer work from version 7.0

b)	At installation or upgrade, you may need to “unblock” the EXE file if you are using Windows 10.  Just right click, properties, and unblock.

c)	From version 7.0 there is no need to run with administrator rights unless you run any of your pinball emulators with administrator rights.

d)	From version 8.12 the installation structure recommended changed for pinball users from collocating with your DirectOutput installation to a separate \DOFLinx folder.  This coincides with the change in DirectOutput to having an installation where 32 and 64 bit versions of DOF can coexist better.
