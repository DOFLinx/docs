# Requirements

- A pinball cabinet -- but then who doesn't have one of these
- If you are running toys (solenoids, flashers, etc)DOF installed and running (Look here
  [http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/dll-updates.html](http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/dll-updates.html)  If you are running an arcade machine with MAME, perhaps DOF2DMD or Pexelcade, then you will not need a full installation of DOF, but it can't hurt if you do.  Of course if, like me, your arcadfe machine has a Pinscape, Dude's Cab, Teensy, then you will need DOF.
- At least one Pinscape Pico, LEDWiz, Pinscape, PacLed64, Ultimate I/O, PinControl1,
  PinControl2, PacDrive, SainSmart, PinOne or Dude's Cab controller
  board
- If you want, a Teensy (or similar) setup for addressable LEDs in DOF
- Keyboard input (or emulator) to your favourite pinball emulator
- Possibly some Xbox or DINPUT controllers
- Some patience
